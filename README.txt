Various programs that I have created over time.

Programs:
 * httpd.c - A stripped http web server.
 * irc_server/* - Hacky version of miniircd with a service bot in C
 * iingage/* - IRC bot based on ii (suckless).
 * tuts/* - Simple C scripts to demonstrate.
 * clest/* - static website container. (Doesn't work well)
 * qemu_scripts/* - Scripts that are useful for making VM's
 
All software released under the LGPLv2+ unless otherwise marked.
